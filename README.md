# Engineering Notebook

Welcome! This is our virtual engineering notebook for 2019-20. Find the compiled `.pdf` file [here](https://github.com/vexteam2019-20/EngineeringNotebook/blob/master/main.pdf).

## Building

This notebook is created using the LaTeX language, and so it requires installation of the LaTeX language.

Build it using `xelatex main.tex -pdf` to build a pdf, assuming you're in the same directory as `main.tex`.

Clear all auxillary files using `latexmk -c`
