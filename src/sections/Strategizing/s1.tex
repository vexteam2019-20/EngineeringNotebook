\section{\textbf{Finding possibilities}: 2019-9-25}
In this meeting, we've decided to start building our strategy, GitHub repositories, and creating an overview of the rules, regulations and specifics of the competition.

\subsection{Starting strategy}
We've decided to split our strategy into two parts: the \textbf{automation} period, and the \textbf{driver control} period.

\subsubsection{Autonomous}
During this 15-sec period, we noticed that drivers aren't allowed to touch the robot or control it. We're only allowed to move the blocks on our half, which means that we have a \textbf{strong advantage}, because we can operate without any opponent interference. We'd like to use this advantage to score points, by putting boxes into our safe zone.
